                        <h1>How do I create a resume to attract the attention of my employer during the war?</h1>
                        <p>It is necessary to emphasize that the labor market has changed as of today. From a candidate's position, it was again transformed into an employer's market. The number of vacancies is decreasing, and the number of job seekers is growing.</p>
                        <h2>The resume should be</h2>
                        <p>Until a few months ago, quite often employers invited candidates to a meeting in the form of exceptions, even without a detailed resume, having only a general idea of the candidate's experience or recommendation from the community. Today, there are significantly fewer such cases. And having a competitive resume, job seekers immediately increase their chances of first contacting a potential employer.</p>
                        <h2>The employer should see your resume</h2>
                        <p>Please note that at the moment, the recruiter of the company that your resume will first get to may be in different life circumstances and have unstable technical capabilities. Therefore, we recommend that you prepare your resume in a format that will be convenient to open both from your phone and from your laptop (by the way, resumes that are prepared in the format WorkId, open equally well from both a laptop and a phone). 
                            Everyone has long known that the quality and success of a resume is not measured by its volume ("the more, the better"), but now this point is becoming very relevant, since in places with unstable internet connections it is not always possible to download large files.</p>
                        <h2>The resume should be clear, structured with correctly placed accents</h2>
                        <p>Get acquainted with the requirements for the position and "highlight" the necessary skills in your resume. This way, you will increase the likelihood that this information will not pass by the employer's eyes.</p>
                        <h2>Don't overuse illustrations and lots of infographics on your resume</h2>
                        <p>Among the abundance of colors, graphs, and flowcharts, it is very difficult to find the right information.</p>
                        <h2>Add multiple contacts for quick communication</h2>
                        <p>This is especially true for those search engines that are at risk of an unstable telephone network. Check that your contacts are up-to-date.</p>
                        <h2>Clearly state the goal and format of the job you are looking for</h2>
                        <p>Please note If you are looking exclusively for remote work. If you are targeting a hybrid format, specify the region where you are looking for a job.if you are ready to relocate, also indicate this.</p>
                        <h2>Please indicate your wishes regarding the salary level</h2>
                        <p>Of course, the issue of wages for both job seekers and employers is an aspect that consists of many introductory materials and is the subject of discussion. But by specifying the amount you are targeting, you will not only save time for all participants in the process, but also fix your financial expectations. During the wartime period, we recommend that you take an even more detailed approach to monetizing your experience. Be prepared for the fact that the wage market may change in any direction. Study the market and see what companies are currently offering. Don't dump or overestimate the value of your experience.</p>
                        <h2>Don't forget your motivation letter</h2>
                        <p>Its presence significantly increases the chance that your resume will be noticed among many others. A well-written motivation letter will help draw your employer's attention to the strengths of your experience. Read the job requirements carefully. Think about how your skills can be useful for the company and why the employer should contact you. 
                            Don't write great memoirs. Less is better, but to the point. When writing a motivation letter, avoid common phrases like" I want to work for your company because it is a market leader "or"I am confident that my skills and experience will help you achieve high performance and develop your business." A recruiter can view hundreds of resumes in a day, and motivation letters written under a carbon copy cause, rather, a negative attitude.</p>
